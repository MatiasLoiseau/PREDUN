PREDUN is an acronym for "Predicción de Deserción Universitaria en UNDAV".

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop and deploy machine learning models to predict student dropout rates at the Universidad Nacional de Avellaneda (UNDAV). By utilizing **MLOps principles**, the goal is to create a scalable, automated, and reproducible system that can predict which students are at risk of dropping out, thereby enabling timely interventions by the university administration.
